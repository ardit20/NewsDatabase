# 🗞️ Streamlit News Filtering App
I made this simple Streamlit app that allows users to filter news articles by country and date range. The app loads a dataset of news articles from a CSV file and displays a dropdown menu of unique Balkan countries and a date range slider.

## Requirements
The following packages are required to run the app:

streamlit
pandas
You can install them using pip.

## 🚀 How to Run the App
Clone the repository or download the news.csv file and the app.py file.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the files are located.
Install the required packages using pip install streamlit pandas.
Run the app using the command streamlit run app.py.
The app should open in your web browser.

## How to Use the App
Select a country from the dropdown menu.
Select a start and end date using the date range slider.
The app will display a table of news articles filtered by the selected country and date range.

##  Example

##  Data Source
The news dataset used in this app was manually compiled by me.
